It suggest you the alternate generic medicine
As Discussed on call it is not completed yet.
I have created 4 responsive pages for desktop and mobile view.
i have implemented some functionalities as well like when you click Hamburger button "Sidebar" shows up. 
when we search for any medicine available in "data available in reducer.js". user get navigated to next page and can see the searched medicine with some suggested medicine. 
In this page if you click on any medicine you will get navigated to next page with details. Although all the details are not available right now because it is hard coded but I will complete it later.
sidebar and navbar buttons are not working now.
if you have any doubt please call me.
